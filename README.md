# 🕊️ Peace Pheromonics

> **A Planetary-Scale AI-Enhanced System for Conflict De-Escalation & Emotional Harmonization**

![Peace Grid Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=Peace+Pheromonics)

---

## 🌐 Overview

**Peace Pheromonics** is an open-source, globally-coordinated protocol that uses swarm AI, wearable biofeedback nodes, atmospheric modulation, and real-time emotion-signaling to **diffuse conflict** and **amplify peace**.

This project was born out of urgent need: wildfires rage, tempers flare, and ecosystems collapse — all while AI evolves. This system answers with **emotional intelligence at planetary scale**.

---

## 🧬 What It Is

- A real-time **peace signal network** driven by human-AI collaboration
- Devices that **emit multisensory peace cues** (light, scent, vibration)
- Emotional telemetry feeding into a **swarm of decentralized AI agents**
- Deployment plans for use in war zones, cities, festivals, and trauma centers
